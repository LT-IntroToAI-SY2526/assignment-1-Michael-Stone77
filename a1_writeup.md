# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_practice_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## What You Need to Submit
1. **Complete the `a1_practice_problems.py` in class**.  Mr. Berg will push solutions to github
2. **Complete the `a1.py` file** with your AI-generated problems and solutions
3. **Complete the reflection questions** in `a1_writeup.md`
4. **Push your changes to GitHub**

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

After completing your problems, reflect on:

1. **What was your initial experience with Python?** How did it compare to other programming languages you've used?
My inital experience with Python was that I tried to use java functions and other things for coding in Python and had to figure out new ways to write functions and everything else in the codes.  It compares to the other programming language I have used in Java script as they both have a similar code structure but Python simplifies the code writing and makes it easier compared to java.
2. **How did you use AI effectively?** Give specific examples of good prompts you used and what you learned from the responses.

3. **What concepts were most challenging?** How did AI help you understand them?
The most challenging concept to me was functions with parameters as the problem the AI gave tricked me up and when I was answering it, I was thinking in terms of java script and not python leading me to struggle at first.  The AI helped understand the concept by breaking down certain parts of it like the parameters and how they worked while also explaining why my function didn't work which helped me get a better understanding of it and be able to confidently work with the concept.
 **What did you learn about collaborating with AI?** What strategies worked best for learning rather than just getting answers?
